      <h1> Final Project </h1>

      <p>Put some stuff in here about what we are going to do</p>

      <h3>Here is a link <a href="https://coolfinancefun.streamlit.app/">to our streamlit app</a></h3>

      <p>The main plot we have now will act as the legend for a cost of living calculator which will be an additional panel in the dash board. The cost of living calculator will have the monthly cost of living with a given salary, the average price of rent, groceries, and other items in Seattle, as well as how much money the user will have left over for savings. The user will be able to scroll over the plot, click on a personâ€™s salary and year, and autopopulated the calculator. See below for an example.</p>
